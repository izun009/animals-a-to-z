{"name": "Aardvark", "facts": [{"fact": "Aardvark Classification and Evolution", "desc": "Aardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows to protect them from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans language in South Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently it was widely believed that they were most closely related to other insectivores such as armadillos and pangolins but this is not the case with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Anatomy and Appearance", "desc": "Aardvarks have a unique appearance amongst mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display physical characteristics of a number of different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks have strong, claws on each of their spade-like feet that along with the fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, makes them strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent sense of smell to both find prey and to sense potential danger."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Distribution and Habitat", "desc": "Aardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions. The only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their underground homes so the aardvark will move to another area where soil conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10 meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be anywhere from 2 to 5 kilometres square. Their burrows often having multiple entrances and are always left head first so they are able to identify potential predators easily using their keen sense of smell."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Behaviour and Lifestyle", "desc": "Aardvarks are mainly solitary animals that come together only to mate and are never found in large groups. They live in underground burrows to protect them both from the hot daytime sun and from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals, only leaving the safety of the burrow under the cover of night when they go in search of food and water, often travelling several miles in order to find the biggest termite mounds guided by their excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite often having a large burrow comprised of an extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also known to be able to quickly excavate small temporary burrows where they can protect themselves quickly rather than having to return to their original dwelling."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Reproduction and Life Cycles", "desc": "Aardvarks have specific mating seasons that occur every year. Depending on the region in which the aardvark lives young can be born either in October to November, or May to June in other areas. Known to have babies most years, female aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that usually lasts for around 7 months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little as 2kg and are born with hairless, pink skin in the safety of their mother’s burrow. Baby aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their lives in the safety of the underground burrow before beginning to venture out with their mother under the cover of night. However, despite accompanying their mother in search of food they aren’t weaned until they are around three months old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in her burrow until they are around six months old when they move out to dig a burrow of their own. Although their lifespan in the wild is not entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more than 20 years in captivity."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Diet and Prey", "desc": "The diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of ants and termites, with termites being their preferred food source. Despite this though, they are known to also eat other insects such as beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to be insectivores, with strong limbs and claws that are capable of breaking into the harder outer shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once they have broken into the mound they then use their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects inside and eat them whole without chewing as they are then ground down in their muscular stomachs. One of the aardvarks most distinctive features is the fact that they have columnar cheek-teeth that serve no functional purpose at all. With some larger ant species that need to be chewed they use the incisors that are located towards the back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to use the same techniques to break into underground ant nests."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Predators and Threats", "desc": "Despite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in the safety of underground burrows, they are threatened by a number of different predators throughout their natural environment. Lions, leopards, hyenas and large snakes (most notably pythons) are the main predators of aardvarks but this does vary depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main form of defence is to escape very quickly underground however, they are also known to be quite aggressive when threatened by these larger animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws to try and injure their attacker along with kicking the threatening animal with their powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural habitats."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Interesting Facts and Features", "desc": "Aardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length meaning they can reach more termites further into the mound. Their love of insects has actually led aardvarks also being known as Antbears! Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought to get almost all of the moisture they need from their prey meaning that they actually have to physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are thought to be one of the world’s most prolific diggers with their strong limbs and claws and shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift 2ft of soil in just 15 seconds!"}, {"fact": "Aardvark Relationship with Humans", "desc": "Due to the fact that they spend the daytime hours hidden in the safety of their underground burrows, only emerging under the cover of night to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen by many people. In some regions though, they are hunted by people for food and are becoming increasingly affected by expanding human populations as more of their natural habitats disappear to make way for growing settlements."}, {"fact": "Aardvark Conservation Status and Life Today", "desc": "Today, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a species that is of Least Concern. Despite the fact that population numbers of aardvarks most certainly declined in some countries, in others, their numbers remain stable and they are often commonly found in both protected areas and regions with suitable habitats. They are however becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in both the form of deforestation and expanding towns and villages. Due to their incredibly elusive nature, exact population sizes are not fully understood."}]},

{"name": "Zorse", "facts": [{"fact": "Zorse Classification and Evolution", "desc": "The Zorse is one of a number of equine hybrids that are known as Zebroids, which is the name given to an equine hybrid that has Zebra ancestry. The Zorse is the result of cross-breeding a generally male Zebra (stallion) with a female Horse (mare) to produce an animal that looks more like a Horse than a Zebra, but one that has stripes."}, {"fact": "Zorse Anatomy and Appearance", "desc": "The Zorse is very Horse-like in appearance as it inherits its shape, size, colour and temperament from its mother. One of the Zorse’s most notable features is the dark stripes that are boldest on their legs and rear, along with also commonly being found on the rest of the body, neck and head. The Zorse is an animal that tends to have short, coarse fur that can range in colour from tan to brown to black, with a darker mane and tail (although the exact characteristics of the Zorse are dependent on the breed of the female Horse). Zorses have a large head with a long muzzle, pricked up ears and large, dark eyes with long eyelashes that help to stop things from getting in their eyes. Zorses have long, thin legs that are incredibly muscular and end in generally black (but sometimes white) coloured hooves that are made from horn and allow the Zorse to be more sturdy when moving through various different terrains."}, {"fact": "Zorse Distribution and Habitat", "desc": "Unlike the case with the Zonkey where there have been a number of wild Zonkey sightings reported, it is almost impossible for a fully wild Zorse to occur without Human intervention of some kind. There are three different sub-species of Zebra that are found in eastern and southern Africa on the vast open grasslands and savannah, but the incredibly rare wild Horse is historically native to parts of Europe and Asia meaning that the two species would not come together naturally in the wild. In parts of Africa though where Human settlements are either close to or intrude on the Zebra’s natural habitat, it is possible for a semi-wild Zorse to occur with the mating of a wild Zebra with a domestic Horse. Nearly all of the world’s Zorses however, are found either in zoos or animal institutes around the world, with a number also being used as work horses particularly in parts of North America."}, {"fact": "Zorse Behaviour and Lifestyle", "desc": "In the wild, both Zebras and Horses roam throughout their natural environment in herds that can contain anywhere from two to more than two hundred individuals, making Zorses relatively sociable animals that prefer to live with other equines. Their temperaments however, are generally similar to those of their mother, including their strong flight response which is heightened by their Zebra side. Zorses are strong and muscular animals that spend the majority of their lives grazing and along with the fact that they are known to have better night vision than people, they are known to have almost 360 degree vision with the exception of a blind spot in front of their nose and directly behind them. The Zorse’s large, pricked ears give it incredible hearing and their large nostrils mean that they also have a keen sense of smell."}, {"fact": "Zorse Reproduction and Life Cycles", "desc": "Zorses are animals that are produced when a male Zebra mates with a female Horse. After a gestation period that usually lasts for around 11 months, the female Horse gives birth to a single Zorse foal. Like the offspring of numerous other hoofed-herbivores, the Zorse is able stand up within an hour after birth and begins to canter a few hours after that. Although they are much smaller in size than their parents, the Zorse is born with incredibly long legs that are actually nearly their adult length already. As with other hybrid animal including both Zonkeys and Mules, the Zorse is sterile meaning that although they still display normal breeding behaviour they are unable to produce offspring of their own. Zorses tend to be very healthy and hardy animals that can live to be more than 30 years old."}, {"fact": "Zorse Diet and Prey", "desc": "Like other equines including both Zebras and Horses, the Zorse is a herbivorous animal meaning that it only consumes plants and plant matter in order to gain all of the nutrients that it needs to survive. They spend almost all of their time grazing and like Horses, the Zorse has an advanced sense of taste which allows it to sort through grasses and grains in search of its most favourable foods. The Zorse primarily eats grasses, herbs and flowers that grow on ground level, along with leaves, fruits and berries that it has to pull from the trees or finds on the floor. Zorses generally will not eat plants that are poisonous, but are known to resort to eating plants that contain toxins when there is not an adequate supply of more nutritious food. Oddly enough the Zorse’s digestive system is designed to have food flowing through it almost continually, allowing them to graze nearly all day if they can."}, {"fact": "Zorse Predators and Threats", "desc": "On the African plains, Zebras are an important source of food for a number of large carnivores including large felines such as Lions, Leopards and Cheetahs along with Hunting Dogs and also Hyenas. Zorses tend to be slightly larger in size than Zebras (depending on the size of their mother) and so would be a bit harder for these powerful predators to kill. In their native habitats, wild Horses are preyed upon by Wolf packs or Bears that try to single out a generally smaller or weaker individual from the herd. The biggest threat to both wild Horses and Africa’s Zebra populations though is habitat loss either in the form of growing Human settlements or to clear land for agriculture, with populations declining throughout much of their natural ranges."}, {"fact": "Zorse Interesting Facts and Features", "desc": "The Zorse is a cross between a Zebra stallion and a domestic mare, but it is also possible to use a Zebra mare and a domestic stallion. This is not that common however because owners of valuable Zebra mares don’t want to waste a year of their breeding life trying to produce a hybrid when they could be producing a Zebra foal instead. In Africa, Zebras and Horses are often cross-bred to create Zorses that are used as trekking animals to transport both people and goods up and down the mountains. As with their Zebra father, the pattern of the Zorse’s bold stripes is unique to each individual animal (much like the fingerprint of Human), meaning that they can be easily distinguished between one another, and if they were found naturally in the wild it could give them some form of camouflage into their surrounding environment."}, {"fact": "Zorse Relationship with Humans", "desc": "The Zorse was originally bred in England and Africa to try and produce a domestic Horse-like animal that was resistant to diseases spread by the Tse Tse Fly in Africa (Zebras have a natural resistance where domestic Donkeys and Horses do not). The experimental crosses were actually becoming popular until early in the 20th century when the ever-improving car industry meant that fewer and fewer people were using Horses for transport. At that point cross-breeding was largely abandoned until a revival of interest came in the early 1990s, with just about every breed of domestic horse imaginable being tried. Zorses are bred and kept today for riding, as work animals and as attractions in zoos and animal institutes around the world."}, {"fact": "Zorse Conservation Status and Life Today", "desc": "Due to the fact that the Zorse is a cross-bred animal and that it cannot continue a population, it is not listed by the IUCN. The three Zebra species though are all listed with the Plains Zebra as Least Concern, the Mountain Zebra as Vulnerable and the Grevy’s Zebra as Endangered.

{"name": "Zonkey", "facts": [{"fact": "Classification", "desc": "The Zonkey is a hybrid animal that is created by cross-breeding two different species of animal that belong to the same genetic group."}, {"fact": "Evolution", "desc": "As far as the evolution of the Zonkey goes, there’s not too much to tell. This species was mentioned by Charles Darwin in his world-changing “Origin of Species,” which was written in 1859. This is recorded proof that they were in existence at that point in history. Dated earlier, a man named Lord Morton cross-bred horses around 1815. So zonkey hybrids have existed in captivity at least since the 19th century."}, {"fact": "Types of Zebroids", "desc": "There are no sub-species of Zonkey, but below is a list of Zebroids–zebras crossed with other members of the horse family:"}, {"fact": "Anatomy and Appearance", "desc": "The Zebra and the Donkey are closely related to one another and both belong to the Horse family means these two species share several similar characteristics including their size. The Zonkey tends to be of a similar size to these animals but takes on a more definitive Donkey-like appearance, with the obvious exception of inheriting the uniquely-striped pattern on their fur from their Zebra parent. Zonkeys and Zedonks (donkey father and zebra mother) are animals that tend to be either tan, brown, or grey in color with a lighter underside, and it is on the lighter parts of their body like their legs and belly where the Zonkey’s darker stripes are most prominent (they are much harder to see on the darker parts). The Zonkey also has a black mane that extends along the ridge of its back to the tip of its black tail, and a large head and ears which makes the Zonkey look much more like a Donkey than a Zebra."}, {"fact": "Distribution and Habitat", "desc": "Out of the three species of Zebra that are found living on the African continent, two are found in Eastern Africa whilst the other is found in more southern regions. Generally preferring to inhabit savannas and open woodlands throughout their historical range, Zebras are often found in enormous herds, particularly on the Serengeti plains where they migrate thousands of miles following the rains that bring new grass. Some are also found in close proximity to human settlements where they are known to have to compete with domestic livestock, such as Donkeys, for food. It is in these areas where Zonkeys are most likely to be produced naturally in the wild as it allows the two separate species to mate. Sadly, however, the world’s Zonkeys tend to be found in zoos and animal institutions where they are generally bred deliberately."}, {"fact": "Behavior and Lifestyle", "desc": "Despite being very similar animals both in appearance and behavior, zebras have not been domesticated like donkeys have. Humans have utilized donkeys for thousands of years for work and other purposes, but zebras have not been tamed because of their more aggressive nature. The Zonkey not only inherits the stripes of the zebra but also its wild streak. One of the Zonkey’s most favorable characteristics is its sheer power–a combination of the stamina of the Donkey mixed with the speed and strength of the Zebra. This gives the zonkey skills that can make it a valuable work animal that can pull heavy loads."}, {"fact": "Reproduction and Life Cycles", "desc": "A male Zebra must be mated with a female Donkey for a Zonkey to be produced. If the sexes are switched, the offspring is a Zedonk. The gestation period can last for more than a year, and then the female Donkey births a single Zonkey foal. Like Zebra and Donkey foals, this foal is also able to stand up just minutes after birth. The Zonkey foal remains with its mother for five to six months of age, at which point it becomes independent and joins another herd. This kind of behavior happens a bit later with Zebra foals, which can take up to four years to leave the herd. Like numerous other hybrid animals, the Zonkey can’t produce offspring of its own, as the cross-breeding of two different species often results in their young being sterile and unable to continue a population."}, {"fact": "Diet and Prey", "desc": "Like Donkeys, Zebras, Horses, and their other relatives, Zonkeys are herbivorous animals meaning that they survive on a diet that is solely comprised of plant matter. The majority of their food is made up of grasses and herbs that grow on the ground and like all equines, the Zonkey has flat, broad teeth which are the perfect tools for grinding down the fibrous grass. Along with grazing, Zonkeys also like to browse for other types of food including fruits and berries which are found growing more common in less arid areas. Due to the fact that Zonkeys are naturally found in the African wilderness, there is always competition for both food and water from other animals inhabiting the same area and so they are always on the move in search of greener pastures."}, {"fact": "Zonkey Predators and Threats", "desc": "Despite their large size and the fact that they are long-living animals, both Zebras and Donkeys (and therefore Zonkeys) are important prey to numerous carnivores throughout their natural range. Lions and Hyenas are their most common predators, along with African Hunting Dogs and large felines like Leopards and Cheetahs. Even though they remain a stable food source for these large predators, they are often hard to catch and Zebras particularly are known to protect wounded individuals to prevent them from being hurt anymore. Although rarer today, one of the biggest threats to both Zebras and Donkeys in Africa has been the fact that they have been subjected to hunting for both their meat and their skins. They are also being pushed into more isolated regions of their natural habitats meaning a decrease in the likelihood of wild Zonkeys."}, {"fact": "Interesting Facts and Features", "desc": "Although we often only think of Donkeys as being domesticated animals, wild herds of Donkeys can still be found living on the continent and in herds up to 100 strong in northern Africa, but this is an area that is not inhabited by Zebras and so the chances of a Zonkey occurring under these conditions would be extremely rare. Zonkeys have been mentioned by naturalists for centuries including Darwin who mentioned the possibility of a fertile female Zonkey that was being exhibited at the London Zoo. The Zonkey is thought to be a popular work animal as they have an apparent resistance to certain pests and diseases, something which is thought to have been inherited from their Zebra father."}, {"fact": "Relationship with Humans", "desc": "Originally bred by Humans to pull heavy loads and thought to have appeared in zoos in the 19th century, the Zonkey first became famous when one was accidentally sired in Colchester Zoo in the 1970s, and they have since continued to exhibit Zonkeys as a popular tourist attraction. Along with now being bred in zoos around the world, Zonkeys are also bred for riding and as work animals involved in transport and pulling heavy loads due to their strength and stamina. In the wild in Africa however, Zebras have come under particular threat from people due to both hunting and loss of habitat for growing Human settlements or land clearance for agriculture."}, {"fact": "Conservation Status and Life Today", "desc": "Because the Zonkey is a cross-bred animal and cannot continue a population, it is not listed by the IUCN. The three Zebra species though are all listed with the Plains Zebra as Least Concern, the Mountain Zebra as Vulnerable, and the Grevy’s Zebra as Endangered.

When a match meets, the male grasps the female’s pectoral fins, and they attach. The pair then lies still together for a while on the ocean floor. Eventually, the male wraps himself around the female and inserts one of his claspers (modifications of the pelvic fins) into her cloaca for a few minutes.Females lay about four brown or purplish eggs at one time, which are ringed with a light layer of hair that clings to the nesting surface. Each breeding season, a single female may lay up to 46 eggs in over 112 days.Depending on the temperature, eggs incubate for five to six months and burst into the world as 20- to 30-centimeter-long (7.9- to 14.2-inch-long) hatchlings.Fascinatingly, zebra shark females can reproduce without males. It’s called parthenogenesis, which means reproduction without fertilization.

Both the Common Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit their native regions in long-term herds that split into smaller family groups which are led by a dominant stallion and contain between one and six mares with their young.

After a gestation period that can last for between 10 months and a year, the female gives birth to a single foal that is born with its stripes and mane and also has a little patch of hair in the middle of its tummy. Zebra foals can stand within minutes of birth, which is vital to ensure that they are able to run away to escape from predators. They are able to begin eating grass after a week and are weaned by the time they are 11 months old. Young Zebras remain with their mother until they are mature at around three years old.

Although their first instinct is to run away, Zebras are sometimes known to attack the animal that is threatening it by kicking and biting. However, when danger is spotted, Zebras alert one another of the threat and by running away from their predator as a tight herd, they often either confuse or simply intimidate their attacker.

These patterns on their rear ends are thought to differ so greatly that members of the same herd can easily identify the individual at the front of the pack when running.

The mating of a zebra and donkey produces a hybrid foal known as a Zonkey, while a zebra mating with a horse produces Zorse. Although it is not thought that the two species would naturally be able to mate in the wild due to geographical differences, a number of both Zonkey and Zorse individuals now exist around the world. Zebras are thought to have natural protection against certain parasites which has led people to breed Horses and Donkeys with Zebras to produce an animal that has the character and size of a Horse or Donkey but with the power and resilience of a Zebra.

The males are smaller than the females but are similarly colored, except for a distinctive deeper yellow ring mid-way down their abdomens. The species lacks pollen baskets, which are necessary to nurture their offspring. They also have vestigial wax glands, which are underdeveloped and are not capable of producing enough wax to construct a nest. These two evolutionary adaptations, which are characteristic of cuckoo bumblebees, have rendered Bombus flavidus incapable of caring for their larvae."}, {"fact": "Behavior", "desc": "Yellowish cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasites and as such depend on other species of bumblebees to rear their offspring. Bombus flavidus queens do not usually assassinate the hose queen. Instead, they infiltrate host colonies, possibly using olfactory mimicry. Olfactory mimicry is the ability to mimic the scent of another species to gain access to their nests or deceive potential mates. Once the cuckoo queen has been accepted by the colony, the cuckoo will lay her eggs in the cells that have been prepared for the host queen’s eggs. Having laid her eggs, the cuckoo leaves the nest and does not return. When her eggs hatch, they feed on the resources of the host colony."}, {"fact": "Habitat", "desc": "The yellowish cuckoo bumblebee lives and forages around the nests of its host species. Because the species is so widespread, yellowish cuckoo bumblebees invade the nests of several different species. Chief among them in North America are the confusing bumblebee (Bombus perplexus), the golden Northern bumblebee (Bombus fervidus), the two-spotted bumblebee (Bombus bimaculatus), the red-belted bumblebee (Bombus rufocinctus), and the American bumblebee (Bombus pensylvanicus). These species construct subterranean nests. They live in the Eastern United States, the Northern Tier States, the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and Alaska. Bombus flavidus forage in taiga, tundra, temperate forests, meadows, and grasslands, and urban gardens. The European yellowish cuckoo bumblebee lives in similar habitats in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland."}, {"fact": "Diet", "desc": "Yellowish cuckoo bumblebees are herbivores. They feed on nectar and pollen. Nectar provides them with energy, while pollen provides essential proteins and nutrients that they need to grow and develop. They are generalist foragers.

Some of the predators that feed on cuckoo bumblebees include wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets, as well as certain species of birds, like flycatchers. Yellowish cuckoo bumblebees are also vulnerable to habitat loss, which reduces the availability of food and nesting sites, making it harder for them to survive and reproduce. Yellowish cuckoo bumblebees are susceptible to the effects of pesticides/herbicides, climate change, and other environmental stressors, as well."}, {"fact": "Conservation Status and Population", "desc": "Bombus flavidus is a species of least concern according to the IUCN RED List of Threatened Species. However, bumblebee populations globally have been declining over the last two decades. Therefore it would follow that Bombas flavidus numbers are trending down. Population estimates are unavailable for this widely dispersed species. Cuckoo bumblebee populations tend to fluctuate wildly from year-to-year, so population estimates from any given year are rather nebulous to begin with."}, {"fact": "Lifecycle", "desc": "The lifecycle of Bombus flavidus is divided into four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The female cuckoo bumblebee queen emerges from hibernation several weeks after her host species. This lag allows the host time to construct a nest. The cuckoo queen immediately sets herself to the task of finding an appropriate nest in which to deposit her eggs. Once she has chosen her target nest, she enters stealthily and patiently awaits her acceptance into the colony. After she has successfully integrated, she deposits her eggs in the cells that have been prepared for the host queen’s eggs. The parasitic cuckoo eggs hatch a day or two before the host’s eggs, giving the cuckoo larva an advantage.The cuckoo larva rely on the host workers for their sustenance. As the cuckoo larva grow they molt several times before pupating. They will completely metamorphose into adult bees, emerging from their subterranean nests approximately 6 to 8 weeks after their eggs were initially deposited. When the days begin to grow shorter in the fall, yellowish cuckoo bumblebees will find individual shelters in which to overwinter. Come the light spring, the cycle begins again."}, {"fact": "Up Next:", "desc": null}]},
